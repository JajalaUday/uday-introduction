# About Me  
Hi, I am Uday Jajala.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a recent Masterâ€™s graduate in Computer Science with about two years of experience as a Junior Java Developer. In my role, I worked on building and improving applications using Java, Spring Boot, APIs, and databases, which gave me a solid foundation in backend development and problem-solving. During my Masterâ€™s, I deepened my understanding of computer science concepts while also working on real projects, so Iâ€™m comfortable combining academic knowledge with hands-on development. I enjoy working in collaborative teams, writing clean and efficient code, and learning new technologies to grow as a developer. 
- ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to grow as a professional and work on impactful projects.
